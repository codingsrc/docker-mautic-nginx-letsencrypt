# docker-mautic-nginx-letsencrypt
This uses the evertramos/docker-compose-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion to make Mautic secure. ALL credit goes to EvertRamos and to the mautic/docker-mautic team. The point of this is for a quick and easy install that will get Mautic up and running in less than 5 minutes.
